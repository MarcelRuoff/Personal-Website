abstract: Multiexperience (MUX) is a term used to describe the trend of users interacting with multiple devices and modalities to complete tasks. This paper provides a conceptualization of MUX and a framework of three paths toward MUX. The benefits and challenges of each path are described, and future research opportunities are outlined.
