abstract: 'Dashboards are increasingly used by governments and health organizations to provide important information to the general public during a crisis. However, in contrast to organizational settings, the majority of the general population has not or rarely used dashboards before and therefore often struggles to interact effectively with these dashboards. To address this challenge, we conduct a design science research (DSR) project to design a conversational dashboard that enables natural language-based interactions to facilitate its effective use. Drawing on the theory of effective use, our DSR project aims to provide theory-grounded design knowledge for conversational dashboards that help users to access and find information via natural language. Moreover, we seek to provide novel insights that support researchers and practitioners in understanding and designing more natural and effective interactions between users and dashboards.'
