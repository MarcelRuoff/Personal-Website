abstract: Teams are crucial for organizations in making data-driven decisions. However, current business intelligence & analytics (BI&A) systems are primarily designed to support individuals and, therefore, cannot be used effectively in co-located team interactions. To address this challenge, we conduct a design science research (DSR) project to design a multimodal BI&A system providing touch and speech interactions that can be used effectively by teams. Drawing on the theory of effective use and existing guidelines for multimodal user interfaces, we propose three design principles and instantiate them in a software artifact. The results of a focus group evaluation indicate that enhancing the BI&A system with multimodal capabilities increases transparent interaction and facilitates effective use of the system in co-located team interactions. Our DSR project contributes novel design knowledge for multimodal BI&A systems with touch and speech modalities that facilitate effective use in co-located team interactions.
